#This is very VERY long, and I apologise for that!

Hello, everybody!

I don't know what sparked me to come back to conlanging again after so long. I just needed the mental challenge, I suppose. Some of you may remember I had a previous conlang called 'zaz' which had the goal of being incredibly small, while retaining all information of a sentence. And it did pretty well! It was just an absolute pain to speak...

So, I set myself out with a new task this week: to create a language which 'lossy' (as opposed to 'lossless') compresses text, in the form of an oligosynth. i.e. I get to cut a lot of corners :P

Without further ado, I'll go over the phonology, grammar, etc, I have wrote down so far, and a hefty corpus of 70 sentences from the [218 sentences list](https://web.archive.org/web/20120427054736/http://fiziwig.com/conlang/syntax_tests.html).

##Morphology

A very simple VCV(C), giving 324 (6\*9\*6) possible roots.  
(C) is optionally added for grammar

The great benefit of this is that you don't need to use any spaces! You simply break between two V's or after two lots of C's.

To make things even smaller, there is a list of paired vowel phonemes which are mixed into one phoneme, but as this is pretty long here's the [list of them](https://pastebin.com/yVZf1fBu) (the two vowels on the left, their combination on the right). Please comment on how I could improve this, as it's very slap-dash the moment! I basically ran out of vowels, by the time I reached the u's.

**Numbers/Colours**

Numbers are represented in a base-5 system, where you simply use the characters as numbers and pop an 'x' on the end. However, unlike my old conlang, zaz, of which this is inspired by (where zaz had *16* vowels *and* consonants to play with), the words cannot be longer than 3 characters. Ergo, you can only represent a number up to 125... eheh... I'll work on it later...  
And for colours, it's an RGB system, where the numerics are used for each of those colours. This gives the language effectively 125 colours! :D  
See the morphology examples.

##Lexicon

The lexicon, I won't post on here just yet. Essentially, I band together similar concepts based on characters. So, at the moment, I have:  
i\*\* - "Language features: pronouns, clause dividers, conditionals"  
e\*\* - "Life, nature, time"  
a\*\* - "Humanity and its stuff"  
o\*\* - "Communication, mathematics, direction"  
q\*\* - "Buildings, furniture, structures, protocols, objects, locations"  
u\*\* - *currently unlabeled*, though I do have 'metre,' 'square,' and 'circle' in there at the moment.

##Grammar

###As morphology

! denotes lexicon lookup  
**-(nothing)** !noun  
**-p** !verb  
**-t** !past  
**-k** !will  
**-f** be  
**-w** of the subject  
**-s** !adj  
**-c** *currently unused*  
**-x** !num/col  
**-h** !proper noun  

I did try other methods of saving space here, with the tensing of verbs, but it was just too common and clumsy to do it any other way.

**Examples**

atip - to want/wanting  
atit - wanted  
atik - will want  
atif - X is desire  
-w - see corpus #31  
atis - desired  
ipex - 001 (base 5) / 20% blue from black  
ikih - "iki"

###Rules

**Adjective/noun placement:**

1. Before the verb of a sentence, an adjective goes before the noun, and vice versa

2. Adjectives follow the verb in order to describe it (c.f. #65)

3. A number is identified as being before the noun, colour after noun (this is affected by 1.)

4. For selection in a collection rather than describing the noun, place the adjective after the noun (this is affected by 1.)

5. 'wood leg' is "leg wood" (walking stick), but 'leg wood' is 'wooden leg' (this is affected by 1.)

6. The above will only span two nouns (c.f. #68 "above-adj collection plant head")

**Possession:**

me food - my food  
you food - your food  
me mouth-verb food you - I eat your food  
animal food-of - the animal's food  
me mouth-verb food-of animal - I eat the animal's food

**Listing:**

verb noun noun noun adjective - all nouns are affected by the verb and the adjective  
noun noun noun verb - all nouns participate in the verb  
See #68 for a case where three nouns in a row do not denote a list, as they are followed by an adjective before the verb

**Direction:**

- must use cardinal directions for 2D

- can use 'up' and 'down' for 3D directions

**That's all, folks!** The rest of it I play by ear, and will probably formalise later.

##Scripts

There are currently 6 scripts, which will be **illustrated through #207 of the corpus (riiiiiiiight at the bottom of this post), in [this link](https://i.imgur.com/n7Q8Y5I.png)**. All the scripts are based around the binary representation of the characters in each word.

The binary of #207 is  11001000.11111010.10011111.11100111.11100010.11010010.11000110.10110010.10100110.10100111.10101010.00011011.10100111.11001100.10001110.10100111.11001100.10001101.10100001.11101000.10110001.10100010.11100100.10101011.00101011.01101110.00111111.11100011.11100000

**Script 1** is 'handwriting' - look closely at the binary of the corpus excerpt, and how the characters of this script are formed. Apart from 's' (0110) and 'h' (1001), all the characters (hopefully) pass through their binary 1's, when the binary is formatted as:

    00
    00

So, for example, 'c' is 0111, producing [this character](https://i.imgur.com/esketER.png).

**Script 2** is 'circle' - just as the handwriting one, you can see that the circles represent the binary of each character, within ever decreasing circles of size, until a space is reached.

**Script 3** is 'triangle', as inspired by /u/Shoninjv's 'Hex' [script](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/7dc93y/750th_just_used_5_minutes_of_your_day/dpwqw3b/). It's simply the binary representation of characters, as chains which flow downwards until after 4 words (in the example given).

**Script 4** is 'isometric', also inspired by the above. It's the most complex, reading left-to-right, moving downwards per word. I've visually aided the break-down of it with colours: the blue is vowels, which are only 3-bits long. If you look at the binary representation of each character, you'll see each vowel's 4-bit binary always starts with a 1, so I've excluded it. So, the top line reads (1)100.1000.(1)111, as VCV.

**'Script' 5** is 'barcode'. It's literally just the binary as laid out by solid bars, no spaces.

**'Script' 6** is 'colourbar'. This is RGB (RedGreenBlue) colour rendered from each 3 bits, no spaces. As it's 4 bits per character, I just multiply its numeric value by 16 to get a value from 0 to 255. Oooor I just take the hex value and stick a hash on the front to make a colour such as #fff!

**Bonus 'script'** is [**audio**](https://vocaroo.com/i/s1sYV2UXPtXy), from 256Hz (B3~C4) to 768Hz (F#~G5) sine wave - 16Hz between each character. Unfortunately I generate this from JavaScript, so there's a click after each sound which I can't seem to fix, but you get the gist!

I think that's all, for now... Any questions, comments, etc, are welcome :)
