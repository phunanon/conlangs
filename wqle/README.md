The alphabet is: pitukymo secahxwq bìdígàná zùjúvòló.


Morphemes are `CV`, where V can be a diphthong.


Lone words beginning with `p` omit the `p` in speech and writing with spaces.  
All words ending in `i` as their V omit the `i` in speech and writing, unless this could cause deletion (pi) or ambiguity (such as without spaces). One may wish to stress between a CVC word and a V word in speech.


When vocalised, speakers may omit the final vowel if they double the length of a matching penultimate vowel. E.g. tìbu /tiubu/ could be spoken /tiuːb/.


Each word has a *genre* depending on its head consonant and vowel. The genres are:

| Genre      | Byte     | Result                         |
| :--------- | -------- | :----------------------------- |
| Noun       | 0xxx0xxx | Unvoiced consonant, lone vowel |
| Adjective  | 0xxx1xxx | Unvoiced consonant, diphthong  |
| (extended) | 1xxx0xxx | Voiced consonant, lone vowel   |
| Verb       | 1xxx1xxx | Voiced consonant, diphthong    |


`(extended)` is used by non-head `CV` in longer words.


Adjectives follow the word they describe.


Contiguous nouns act as `noun [of] noun`. Pronouns are excluded from this.


There can be multiple subjects to a verb, all contributing to the carrying out of that verb. For example: `I brush paint wall` - *I paint wall with brush*.


Addressing a person with their label acts as the pronoun.


Verbs at the end of a clause (not including adjectives) are intransitive, whereas verbs with objects after them are transitive.  
Intransitive verbs can be overloaded with multiple subjects, for example: `I hold table` - *I hold up the table*; `I table hold` - *I hold onto the table.*


Personal labels or pronouns at the beginning of a clause are instructional.


Verbs at the beginning of a clause are first person by default.


Consecutive verbs take on the tense of the last verb if present, or their own tenses if present.


Tense adjectives at the beginning of a clause describe the whole clause.


Numbers begin with `wi`; `bi, ba, di, da, gi, ga, ni, na, zi, za`, `je, ja, ve, va, le, la` constitute 0 to 9, A to F. Append morphemes to compose numbers, such as `wibabi` for 10. `(wi)bu` is used to denote a decimal point.


`soft_and` can be used to allow contiguous forms of grammar, while enabling both constituent parts of the form to be their own entity. For example:  
`they "forget mother soft_and child plural` - they forget the mother and the children of said mother


The pronoun-verb repeated pattern acts as a chain of effects, for example: `I tell you tell them` - I tell you to tell them.


Kin and relationships begin with `cq` then the following morphemes, which can be chained together as nouns:

| wqle | relation  |
| ---- | --------- |
| `bi` | parent    |
| `di` | child     |
| `gi` | partner   |
| `ni` | neighbour |
| `zi` | sibling   |
| `ji` | friend    |
| `vi` | stranger  |


Units are as follows:

| wqle   | name     | type               | derived from      |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `waji` | second   | time               |                   |
| `waja` | metre    | length             |                   |
| `wagy` | kilogram | mass               |                   |
| `waga` | litre    | volume             | `10^-3 - m^3`     |
| `wagu` | mole     | substance amount   |                   |
| `wabi` | kelvin   | temperature        |                   |
| `waba` | Celsius  | temperature        | `K + 273.15`      |
| `wabu` | candela  | luminous intensity |                   |
| `wave` | joule    |                    | `kg • m^2 • 2^-2` |
| `wava` | watt     |                    | `J/2`             |
| `wavu` | ampere   | electric current   |                   |
| `wavy` | volt     |                    | `W/A`             |
| `walu` | radian   |                    | `π/2`             |
| `wale` | degree   |                    | `π/180`           |


A conditional is expressed as: condition if_then result. For example:  
A song can make or ruin a person’s day if they let it get to them.  
person let song affect reflexive if_then make or ruin day 'their
